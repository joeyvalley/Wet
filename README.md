Wet is a band that I founded with friends in the summer of 2012. Over the past ten years we have released three critically-acclaimed albums and EPs, toured internationally with a diverse network of artists, and appeared on television and in film. 

Throughout the band's career, I've built and maintained our website -- from very basic ASCII-art HTML pages to the (relatively) more involved iteration that is currently up.

This version of the site is one of the first independent projects I completed during my software engineering fellowship at General Assembly. I utilized some of the early basics we were learning -- HTML/CSS, vanilla Javascript, APIs -- to build out a straightforward site with reliable mobile compatility baked into the CSS. It was a great learning experience because, in the past, I had basically hobbled things together in a very adhoc way and with this version I finally felt I was making architectural and stylistic choices in much more informed and confident manner.

I plan to continue updating the site in the future and using it more or less as a means of playing around with new innovations in HTML and CSS as these tools continue to improve and offer new functionalities.
